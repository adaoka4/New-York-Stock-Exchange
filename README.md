#Analysis of NYSE Data for S&amp;P 500 Companies

In this project, I calculated summary statistics, drew inferences from the statistics if any, calculated business metrics, and used models to forecast future growth prospects for S&P 500 companies using New York Stock Exchange historical financial data  from the companies. My goal was to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways. The data consisted of fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index as well as industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index. 

I used a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV, IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, VLOOKUP) and tools like dropdowns, data validation, pivot tables.
